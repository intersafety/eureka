- Safe Prompt Generation

Roadmap:
- MVP of Chrome Extension (snipe Grammarly and reskin)
- Sliding Window Algorithm [https://medium.com/@rishu__2701/mastering-sliding-window-techniques-48f819194fd7] to analyse the input every word added to re-hash the prompt, remember to add toggles for "JSON Prompting" "Sound less like AI" "Use my voice"
- Tap intersafety API to test for dangerous prompts for final filter
